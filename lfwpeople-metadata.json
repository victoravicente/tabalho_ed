The data set contains more than **13,000 images** of faces *collected from the web*. Each face has been labeled with the name of the person pictured. **1680** of the people pictured have *two or more distinct photos in the data set*. The only constraint on these faces is that they were detected by the **Viola-Jones face detector**.\n\n![LFW-PEOPLE](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F1746215%2F92752ca2b0bbecdd3fd154b88495558d%2F1_RaupR7k7NrrTJZvop7sH-A.png?generation=1573849119616339\u0026alt=media)\n\n\nThis dataset is a collection of **JPEG pictures** of famous people collected on the internet. All details are available on the official **website**: http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/\n\nEach picture is centered on a single face. Each pixel of each channel (color in RGB) is encoded by a float in **range 0.0 - 1.0**. \n\nThe task is called Face Recognition (or Identification): given the picture of a face, find the name of the person given a training set (gallery). \n\nThe original images are **250 x 250 pixels**, but the default slice and resize arguments reduce them to **62 x 47** pixels.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe wouldn\u0027t be here without the help of others. I would like to thank **Computer Vision Laboratory, university of Massachusetts** for providing us with such an excellent database.\n\n### Inspiration\n\nI had an activity in my college for facial recognition. I came up with this as the best kind of dataset for my task. I am posting it here on Kaggle to make it available for other data scientists conveniently and see what magic they can perform with this amazing dataset."}
